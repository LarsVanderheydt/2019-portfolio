# My porfolio

## Made with:
- [CurtainsJS](https://www.curtainsjs.com/)
- I used [this](https://codepen.io/martinlaxenaire/pen/ROgEKj) example to get the color effects and played around with the variables and tweaked the fragment shader a little bit.

> Note: the shaders are all copied from the example from above, I find it very hard to make them myself but like to tweak and try understand them as much as possible
