What I really want to make clear is that the effects are created using curtainsJS and a combination of there codepen examples. Previously I learned about shaders, but these are pretty hard but the effects are pretty cool! So by learning about them and trying to understand the code I am able to tweak the examples to my will. To learn which examples were used see the Github repo below.",
